- 👋 Hi, I’m @RyanKruger1
- 👀 I’m interested in learning NodeJs and Creating cool things
- 🌱 I discovered the other day that i can code my own discord bots and i have been immersed in coding bots since then. Web services really gets my creative juices flowing. My dream has always been to create something that is of use to people or makes the world a better place. I believe code has the most potential to do exactly that. IoT is a big passion of mine as well. I really like playing with micro-controllers and various communication capabilities these devices posses to use them in a bigger system.
